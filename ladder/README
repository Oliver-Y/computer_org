This directory contains a program to compute word ladders.

You can
   make ladder
and it works:
   ladder ape man
or
   ladder -d knuth black raven
knuth holds the hand-wraught 5,757 word dictionary of five letter words from
Donald Knuth (thanks: Stanford GraphBase).

You can switch the lookerUpper in ladder.c to use isWordAsm and it will
make use of the assembly alternative to isWord.

You can
   make tests
and it will compare against benchmark tests from Ubuntu boxes. (Tests will
fail on other devices if the dictionary differs.)

You can make clean, make realclean, or make love.  Whatever your preference.

Enjoy!
 Duane
