This is the source for Robert Abbott's Theseus and Minotaur puzzle.
A curses-based implementation by Duane Bailey (c) 2015-2019.

It may be built by typing:
   make theseus

You will see that this compiles and links theseus.c with chase.c.  Your job
is to implement the minotaur-moving procedure moveM.  This is documented in the
lab sheet, found in theseus.pdf.

The levels directory contains all the files necessary to play the game:
  * there are 88 levels of play (00.lvl-87.lvl)
  * there is an emacs work facade screen (WORK)
  * there is a screen of help (HELP)
Any of these may be edited as you see fit.

To run theseus, simply type:
  theseus
To run it on a particular level (say 10), type:
  theseus 10
There is a zero-level, for quick testing.  The program starts, by default, 
at level 1.

EDITS:
The system keeps track of the player's biometric indicators.  You may wish
to enter your birthday in chase.c on the line:
   int BDay[] = { <month>, <day>, <year> };

Enjoy!
 Duane
