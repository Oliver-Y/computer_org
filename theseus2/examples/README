This directory contains some simple C functions and procedures and their
translation into assembly language.  See the x86 guide for more details
on the calling conventions used here.

THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT BUILD ON A MAC due to slightly different calling
conventions and an older-style compiler.  All assembly work should be
done using Linux boxes with gcc.

To build:
  make

This constructs an executable, prime.  It filters primes from the input:
  # seq 10 | prime
  2
  3
  5
  7
  #

Another example:
  make prog

This constructs an executable, prog.

The program is based on prog.c, pattern.s, and gcd.s.

The files pattern.c and gcd.c are only motivational.

Running prog generates the following output:
