  Theseus and Minotaur is a puzzle where our hero Theseus (t) races for a
goal (@) before the evil Minotaur (m) catches him.  It's hard.
  At any time Theseus may move in any of the four compass directions...or he
may sit still.  After Theseus moves, the Minotaur takes TWO moves: he's fast!
The Minotaur moves as follows:
       1.) If a horizontal move takes him closer to Theseus, that's his move.
       2.) Otherwise, if a vertical move is possible, he moves that way.
There are walls which can impede movement; it's a maze.
  The challenge is to solve each level, in the fewest moves possible.

Symbols: t = Theseus    . = open space    m = Minotaur
         T = Theseus in goal (you win!)   M = Minotaur in goal
    	       * = Minotaur ravaging Theseus (yikes! you lose)

Keys: ^N  Move Theseus up one line       ^P  Move Theseus down one line
      ^B  Move Theseus left one space    ^F  Move Theseus right one space
      ^-SPACE Theseus eats lunch         ^_  Backup one move (undo)
      ^U  Repeat next command 4 times    ?   Get help
      SPACE Put up emacs facade          ^G  Give up playing theseus
